  - Excellent support for complex queries and transactions
  - Strong data integrity and consistency

- **Redis**: Used for caching and job queue management
  - Fast in-memory data store
  - Perfect for session management and caching
  - Used with BullMQ for background job processing

### ORM & Data Management
- **Prisma**: Modern ORM for database operations
  - Type-safe database queries
  - Automatic migrations
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Built-in seeding capabilities for development

### API Integration & Resilience
- **Axios**: HTTP client for external API calls
  - Promise-based HTTP client
  - Easy to use and configure
  - Wide browser and Node.js support

- **Axios-Retry**: Resilience pattern implementation
  - Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
  - Configurable retry strategies
  - Helps handle transient failures gracefully

### Background Processing
- **BullMQ**: Job queue management
  - Reliable job processing
  - Automatic retries
  - Job prioritization
  - Used for email report generation

### Email Handling
- **Nodemailer**: Email sending functionality
  - Flexible email transport
  - Support for various email providers
  - Used with MailDev for development testing

### Validation & Security
- **Class Validator**: Input validation
  - Decorator-based validation
  - Type-safe validation rules
  - Prevents invalid data entry

- **Class Transformer**: Data transformation
  - Object serialization/deserialization
  - Type conversion
  - Helps maintain data consistency

### Scheduling
- **@nestjs/schedule**: Cron job management
  - Declarative cron job definitions
  - Easy scheduling of recurring tasks
  - Used for daily report generation

## Development & Deployment

### Local Development
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization
  - Consistent development environment
  - Easy service orchestration
  - Isolated services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MailDev)
  - Simplified local setup

### Version Control
- **Node Version Check**: `check-node.sh` script
  - Ensures correct Node.js version
  - Prevents version-related issues
  - Runs before application start
